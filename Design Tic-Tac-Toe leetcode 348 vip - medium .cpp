Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Example:
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | | // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | | // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| | // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| | // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
Follow up:
Could you do better than O(n2) per move() operation?

Hint:

Could you trade extra space such that move() operation can be done in O(1)?
You need two arrays: int rows[n], int cols[n], plus two variables: diagonal, anti_diagonal.


我们首先来O(n2)的解法，这种方法的思路很straightforward，就是建立一个nxn大小的board，其中0表示该位置没有棋子，1表示玩家1放的子，2表示玩家2。那么棋盘上每增加一个子，我们都扫描当前行列，对角线，和逆对角线，看看是否有三子相连的情况，有的话则返回对应的玩家，没有则返回0

class TicTacToe {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    TicTacToe(int n): rows(n), cols(n), N(n), diag(0), rev_diag(0) {}

    int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int add = player == 1 ? 1 : -1;
        rows[row] += add; 
        cols[col] += add;
        diag += (row == col ? add : 0);
        rev_diag += (row == N - col - 1 ? add : 0);
        return (abs(rows[row]) == N || abs(cols[col]) == N || abs(diag) == N || abs(rev_diag) == N) ? player : 0;
    }

private:
    vector<int> rows, cols;
    int diag, rev_diag, N;
};
