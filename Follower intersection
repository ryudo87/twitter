Question
An @reply will be sent to the people who follow the sender and the user mentioned. For example, if @shaq sends an @reply to @ladygaga, the tweet would be sent to users who follow @ladygaga and @shaq.
built a system to show the list of users who will see a given tweet. How would you do this?

 this problem is about finding the intersection of two arrays.

Solution 1
Create a hash, mapping user id to user object, for the first set of followers. 
Then loop over the second timeline, storing users from the second collection if they also exist in the hash.
The runtime cost for two sequential loops is O(B.length)  + O(A.length) * O(1) --> O(B.length + A.length).

Solution 2
Given sorted lists, use binary search for the larger set rather than iteration (assuming both sets are sorted). This is useful if one set is much larger than the other.
The algo complexity for this solution would be O(B.length * log A.length)
